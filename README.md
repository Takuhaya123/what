# MgMananghaya Project Proposal
## Title: F1: A Battlefield of Skill and Logistics
******
### Description
### This webpage aims to talk about the sport which includes the drivers themselves, together with their teams and the logistical hurdles they have to overcome. It is a very interesting sport to me and is something that I am very interested in, so this was my best option to stay motivated throughout the two quarter duration of this project. I want to show my readers that there is more to the sport than just skilled drivers racing in circles hoping for a win.
