# MgMananghaya Project Proposal
## F1: Trials of Skill and Logistics
******
### Description
### This webpage aims to talk about the sport which includes the drivers themselves, together with their teams and the logistical hurdles they have to overcome. It is a very interesting sport to me and is something that I am very interested in, so this was my best option to stay motivated throughout the two quarter duration of this project. I want to show my readers that there is more to the sport than just skilled drivers racing in circles hoping for a win.

### Webpage Breakdown:
### Home Page: The home page will contain a simple menu which will allow the user to go to each of the other 5 web pages.
### P1 (Sport Overview): This page will discuss the main themes and mechanics of the sport. It will also briefly discuss the history of Formula 1 and its different eras.

#### Other Notes:
#### - Each subpage has a menu at the side in the form of a circular figure representing a tire, which will expand upon mouse hover and show the other pages
#### - The bottom of the pages will contain various information such as the author of the webpage.
#### - The 6th page (sources page) will not be in the side menu but will be located elsewhere (It will probably be a hyperlink of some sort at the bottom of each page.)
